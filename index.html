<b style="padding-left:25px;">🤍 this code was taken from sahil chinoy's "2021 in music" <a href="https://observablehq.com/@sahilchinoy/2021-in-music">observable notebook</a>. thanks, sahil.</b>
<p>🏳️ each dot is a single play. when you mouse over, it highlights the same track in <span style="color:#0000ff">blue</span> and the same artist in <span style="color:#e6ab02">yellow</span>.</br>
🏳️ i lived in GMT from jan to sept, but the times are shown in EST. but, i basically lived and worked EST hours while i was there, so it still mostly works.</br></p>

<summary><b>💬 here are some of my personal 2021 music-related fun facts you absolutely didn't ask for</b></summary>
<ul>
<li>▫️ my <b>first show</b> back from lockdowns was inhaler's headlining album show at przym in kingston. i got my second vaccine the day before, and i took a train to london the following morning.</br> ➡️ the lady who gave me the shot said i should go and have a good time. i remember it all being very surreal as soon as i stepped inside the venue.</li>
<li>▫️ i saw <b>inhaler</b>—wow, when i'm typing this, i actually can't remember—either eleven or twelve times last year. this is on top of seeing them open for blossoms once in 2019, their only US tour before this year.</li>
<li>▫️ i went to <b>three UK festivals</b>: reading festival (friday), neighbourhood weekender in warrington, and trnsmt in glasgow. previously, i had only been to leeds fest in 2019.</li>
<li>▫️ i got <b>tattoos</b> for the strokes ("12:51" on my right arm), alex turner (dedicated to "stuck on the puzzle"), and blossoms. nothing against blossoms, but that one sucked, so i'm currently getting it removed lol.</li>
<li>▫️ i saw <b>sam fender</b> five times over the summer, including barricade when he was second-to-top at trsnmt and (accidentally, long-ish story) barricade london's brixton academy.</li>
<li>▫️ i also saw <b>sea girls</b> five times, and they were actually the only show i saw in edinburgh (liquid rooms), and the last show i saw before i moved back to nyc. </br> ➡️ i got a setlist at that last show, left it in the venue bathroom, went to the train station, and cried. i later realized i was crying bc a big phase of my life was ending, and i was just letting it out via the setlist debacle.</li>
<li>▫️ i saw shows in: <b>edinburgh</b>, <b>glasgow</b>, <b>manchester</b>, <b>liverpool</b>, <b>sheffield</b>, <b>leeds</b>, <b>london</b>, <b>brighton</b>, and <b>leicester</b>. i feel like i'm missing one, but let's move before i pull out my google calendar and flip back to last year. </br> ➡️ i went to newcastle, but i'm sad i didn't see anything there.</li>
<li>▫️ i bought fifteen copies of the <b>inhaler record</b>, including one where my favorite member wrote my favorite lyrics from "12:51" on it ("the world is shutting out for us").</li>
<li>▫️ my favorite record of the year, though, was sam fender's <em>seventeen going under</em>. it was a really tough debate between that and arlo parks' <em>collapsed in sunbeams</em>. even while i type it, i'm tempted to change my mind.</li>
<li>▫️ my favorite new artist of the year was dylan fraser. i heard his first single, "vipers," premiere on the radio back in 2019. he released two EPs in 2021, and they are mint.</li>
<li>▫️ my favorite song was—indie kids everywhere hold for surprise (not)—"chaise lounge" by wet leg.</li>
<li>▫️ i was supposed to celebrate 2022 with julian casablancas telling me "happy new year" at barclays center, but it's now moved until april 6. i'm not sure the year will actually start until then.</li>
<li>▫️ interestingly, there has been a shift since december, and i've stopped listening to as much new music. if i got my january 2022 data, it would be older artists. search "the stone roses."</li>
<li>▫️ <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EUMDoJuT8yJsl?si=44c5551c551045d1">here</a> is my 2021 spotify wrapped playlist.</a></li>
